This project contains vector adder code for generating FPGA using vivado HLS. 
Different types of vector adder are included e.g float,double, real,complex.
The data width of bus also customized.
Unoptimized directory contains the soution for IP without pipelining while the optimized directory consist of IP with pipelining.
