Note: The table above shows the Block RAMs at the current stage of the synthesis flow. Some Block RAMs may be reimplemented as non Block RAM primitives later in the synthesis flow. Multiple instantiated Block RAMs are reported only once. "Hierarchical Name" reflects the Block RAM name as it appears in the hierarchical module and only part of it is displayed.
